# OdysseeyJS for Squirrels

Since our January meetup, wherein we used squirrels as a theme for learning about LeafletJS, maptimeLEX and maptimeBoston, the latter of which is staunchly pro-rat, have been in a protracted #maptimewar. To get caught up to speed, check out the videos below produced by maptimeLEX and maptimeBoston, respectively:

Most of the vitriole has come from the folks in Beantown, but we've managed to stand our ground pretty well thus far.That said, it's time to go on the offensive!

## Fighting Back with OdysseyJS

For this March meetup, we are going to try and keep things simple. We will use CartoDB's story mapping platform, OdysseyJS, to create maps that, through sheer volume and wit, will bring those ratscallions to their grimy knees! Don't pull your punches. These are some nasty folks we're up against. If you need some inspiration, remember their blatant act of aggression, pouring a beloved Central Kentucky beveridge into Boston Harbor!

## Getting started with OdysseyJS

The easiest way to get going with OdysseyJS is with their [sandbox editor](http://cartodb.github.io/odyssey.js/sandbox/sandbox.html). In the sandbox you see your map in the background and a simple text editor in the foreground. As you make changes to your map in the text editor, those changes nearly immediately reflected in your map. Pretty cool! You also don't have to login or create an account with CartoDB (for now). Projects developed in the sandbox are saved as Gists which will have a persistent URL for handy access.
